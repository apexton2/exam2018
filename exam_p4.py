What is Fun?

During my experience with python, it has been most interesting to learn that understanding python is like understanding a foreign language.
There are so many aspects about programming with python that serve as building blocks to learning more and more complex capabilites. This has
challenged me and made me think more creatively about using python to solve problems and discover new and exciting applications. In specific,
I enjoyed learning how I could apply text analysis to openly available data sources to uncover cool and interesting insights. Something I would
love to pursue with my python knowledge is learning how to scrape social media data to understand trends that could drive process such as product/
service pricing, identifying target market segments and inventory management. Now that I have built a foundational knowledge of python, I am excited
pursue projects that I am passionate about and feel are valuable in today's online global exchange of information.
